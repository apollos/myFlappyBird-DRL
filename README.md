# myFlappyBird-DRL
Create a DQN for flappyBird
I learn the code from https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird. And I will make the code more clear and general for other games.

The DQN file is brainDQN.py which is leverage Tensorflow

To play the game locally, run "python flappyBirdLocal.py"

To play the game remotely, run "python flappyBirdRemote.py" on the Tensorflow node and then run "python game/playGameRemote.py Tensorflow-node-ip 9129"
